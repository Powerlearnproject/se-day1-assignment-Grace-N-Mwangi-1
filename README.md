#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a discipline focused on the systematic development of high-quality software products using engineering principles, methods, and tools.
It plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of reliable, scalable, and innovative software solutions that meet user needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The birth of software engineering (1968)-The term "software engineering" was first coined during the NATO Software Engineering Conference held in 1968 in Garmisch, Germany. It laid the foundation for software engineering as a distinct discipline, focusing on methods, tools, and best practices for producing high-quality software.
The Introduction of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)- It introduced the idea of organizing code into small, manageable blocks or modules, each with a single entry and exit point, thereby making programs easier to understand, debug, and maintain.
The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2001)- This revolutionized software engineering by shifting the focus from heavy documentation and rigid planning to adaptive planning, continuous improvement, and iterative development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements. 
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach to software development. It follows a strict sequence of phases where each phase must be completed before the next one begins, with little to no overlap between stages. Once a phase is completed, it is difficult to go back and make changes. It is best suited for projects with well-defined, unchanging requirements and a need for thorough documentation, such as: Government, construction or manufacturing projects.
Agile is an iterative and flexible approach to software development. It focuses on delivering small, incremental improvements to the software through cycles called sprints or iterations. It emphasizes collaboration, adaptability, and customer feedback. Development is broken into smaller units, allowing for continuous improvement and flexibility to change requirements as the project progresses. Ideal for projects where requirements are expected to evolve, such as start-ups and new product development projects.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions. 
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA). Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance in software quality assurance: Testing helps to identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products that meet specified quality standards and functional requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
Importance: Prompt engineering helps avoid getting confusing answers from AI models by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need."

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Tell me about medicine
Improved prompt: Tell me about the history of internal medicine
The improved prompt is more effective because it is more specific and provides context, hence helping the AI model understand the request better.
